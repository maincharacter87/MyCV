    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Jane, and I'm a maths teacher from South Africa who is making a career change into technology. My passion for educational technology has led me on this exciting journey, and I can't wait to see where it takes me. </p>
        <p>I have an undergraduate degree in business science, which has given me a strong foundation in business principles and an understanding of the importance of technology in the modern world. As a maths teacher, I have honed my skills 
        in explaining complex concepts in simple terms, which I believe will be valuable in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>I'm an active, outgoing, and cheerful person who enjoys spending time outdoors, travelling, and taking on new challenges. I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow, and my positive attitude makes me a pleasure to work with.
        I'm excited to bring my enthusiasm for technology and my passion for education to my new career.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Programming </li>
            <li> Data Analysis </li>
            <li> EdTech </li>
        </ul> 
        <br>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Bachelor of Business Science (University of Cape Town, 2011)</li>
            <p> During my undergraduate studies at the University of Cape Town, I had the opportunity to take courses in calculus and statistics, which provided me with the fundamental knowledge and tools needed to conduct rigorous analysis.In my thesis dissertation, Fundamental Indexation on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, I built indexation models for exchange traded funds based on company fundamental metrics to investigate if greater risk-adjusted returns could be achieved compared to market-capitalization weighted indices. This experience sparked my interest in the power of data and its ability to inform decisions.</p>
            <li> Post Graduate Certificate in Education (University of Cape Town, 2019) </li>
            <p> I completed my PGCE certification with a specialisation in Mathematics education, graduating with distinction. </p>
            <li> Software Engineering (HyperionDev, 2023) </li>
            <p>  I am currently completing an in person software engineering bootcamp with HyperionDev. This training has provided me with a foundation in programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, machine learning and computer networking. I have also gained hands-on experience working with languages such as Python and SQL.
        </ul>
        <br> 

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Mathematics Teacher (2020-2022)</li>
            <p> I taught Mathematics for 3 years at South Peninsula High School. This school serves students from the historically disadvantaged Cape Flats area, affected by gang violence and poverty. I designed an adapted curriculum and developed learning materials for remote and hybrid learning during extended COVID related school closures. This experience has taught me the value of leadership, communication and collaborative problem solving in challenging environments.</p>
            <li> English Teacher (2011-2018)</li>
            <p> I taught English at Soryong Elementary School in South Korea, where I was received the Gunsan City Mayorâ€™s Award for Excellence in Education</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
    
    <h2>Past Projects</h2>
        <p>During my studies at HyperionDev I have worked on a number of Capstone Projects which aim to showcase the skills I am developing.</p>
        <p>I recently made a task manager for a small business.</p>
